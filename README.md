## 💼 About Me

I'm a data analyst with a background in Psychology and a passion for turning raw data into actionable insights. My experience spans healthcare analytics, digital campaign optimization, and performance reporting using tools like SQL, Tableau, and Excel.

Currently pursuing my M.S. in Business Intelligence/Data Analysis at Brooklyn College, I’ve completed projects involving CMS healthcare metrics, COVID-19 dashboards, and advertising performance analytics.

I'm always looking for ways to combine business goals with data-driven strategies to drive better outcomes.
